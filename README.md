## About this Project

This is a Food Shop Searcher implemented with Vue and Firebase. In this app you can search for the availability of specific food items in supermarkets and convenience stores your region. Users can ensure that the item they are looking for is available in the store, before they visit it. In addition, there is a visitor estimator for each shop that informs users about the number of customers in each shop in real time, in order to avoid overcrowding.
